# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Predictive-Models
"This repository contains machine learning models developed to detect fraud in credit card transactions. By applying dataset analysis, feature engineering and various classification algorithms, fraudulent transactions are successfully distinguished."

This project is a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions. The dataset includes transactions made by credit card holders in Europe in September 2013. The model uses various algorithms to predict whether transactions are fraudulent or not.

Technologies
Python: The main language for data processing and modeling.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
